#### Welcome to Kavanah Forum

There is a well-known perennial problem in the space of traditional Jewish prayer: <em>prayers are difficult to connect with</em>, whether because of a language barrier, because of the way it's routinized, or because the content doesn't resonate in an obvious way. Kavanah Forum is a web application that seeks to offer a partial solution through a crowd-sourced approach: users that have successfully found meaningful ways to connect to different parts of the prayer service can post about their approaches, and users struggling to connect can browse existing content, or post questions that others can answer. Think of Kavanah Forum as a hub for the collected wisdom of the Jewish world's pray-ers.
