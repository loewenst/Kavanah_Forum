## What is Kavanah?

There is a well-known perennial problem in the space of traditional Jewish prayer: <em>prayers are difficult to connect with</em>, whether because of a language barrier, because of the way it's routinized, or because the content doesn't resonate in an obvious way. Kavanah Forum is a web application that seeks to offer a partial solution through a crowd-sourced approach: users that have successfully found meaningful ways to connect to different parts of the prayer service can post about their approaches, and users struggling to connect can browse existing content, or post questions that others can answer. Think of Kavanah Forum as a hub for the collected wisdom of the Jewish world's pray-ers.

## Usage

Users can interact with the content of the application through the "browse" tab. This takes users to a master list of all prayer categories, with clickable links to individual prayers.

On each individual prayer's page, users can view all existing posts and questions for that prayer. Clicking a post brings users to the post's page, where they can see more information about the post, as well as any comments. The same applies to clicking a question and seeing all responses.

Logged in users also have the option to add posts, comments, questions and responses, and edit or delete any that they have made.

Posts take a very specific form - they must include at least one emotion and a brief description, as well as optional fields for additional emotions, an elaboration and sources. The rationale for this format will be explained in depth in a forthcoming wiki.
